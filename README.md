# 💡LIBFT

The objective of this project is creating my own library.


# ℹ️Introduction

C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to the highly useful
standard functions. 

This project is about understanding the way these functions work,
implementing and learning to use them. Your will create your own library. 

It will be helpful since you will use it in your next C school assignments.

Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year. However, when working
on a new project, don’t forget to ensure the functions used in your library are allowed in
the project guidelines.


# 👨‍💻Usage


The functions are written in C language and thus 
needs the gcc compiler and some standard C libraries to run.

1. Compiling the library

	To compile, clone the repository and run the following inside the folder:

```bash
$make
```

2. Using it in your code

	To use the library functions in your code, simply include its header:

```C
#include "libft.h"
```

	and compile the libft.a library with your files.

# ✅update

In addition to the functions from the subject pdf i have added my own functions such as printf 
and get next line to use in my other projects.
